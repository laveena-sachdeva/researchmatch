# ResearchMatch - A portal for professors and students to post and seek opportunities

## Description
As current Masters’s students, we feel that it is very difficult for a student to find relevant research opportunities on-campus. They need to reach out to individual professors inquiring about open positions. This also means that the professor has to go through an overwhelming number of emails and talk about the same job opportunity individually with every student. To address this problem, we have built ResearchMatch - A portal for professors and students to post and seek opportunities. This portal allows Professors to post jobs, look at students’ profiles, communicate with them via messages. The students can search for jobs posted by a particular professor, view professors’ areas of interests, apply for jobs, communicate with the professor on the portal, etc.
This will help the students to see job opportunities without reaching out to the professor. This will also decrease the burden of keeping track of all the student emails for the professor, thus increasing the efficiency of both the involved parties. We have also integrated a contentclassification framework to remove some of the applicants based on the skill-match level.

## Possible future improvements
We have accomplished all the basic things for the scope of this course project, but there are several improvements and advancements that can be made. Firstly, we have not integrated email verification in our project. That can be done in the future to ensure the authenticity of the users. As of now, we have created the front-end for the ‘Forgot Password’ functionality. If the email
authentication feature is integrated in the future, this ‘Forgot Password’ functionality can also be made functional. Also, as of now the scope of the project is limited to the United States. It can be further broadened to other countries and worldwide.
Some of the other improvements can be related to allowing updates. To demonstrate this ability, we have given the user an option to update profile. Similar functionality can be added for the professor to be able to update older job postings. They should also be able to update the status
of any applicant any number of times, and not just once as of now. Another feature that can be improved is the ‘Search people’ feature. In the future, if the user name searched is not present, the application can give suggestions about closely related user names instead of not returning any
results. Also, in the future, we can give the users an option to apply for each job with a different skillset input, highlighting the skills related to that job, instead of applying with the same skillset description for every job. Another improvement that can be done is to allow users to search for
jobs based on keywords, allow the job-poster to attribute tags with each job, recommend jobs to the students based on the skill-match, etc. In the conversation feature, we have not added the functionality to share files. That can be added in future versions of the application.
We believe that we have been able to create prototype for an application that can be used to ease and transform the process of Student-Professor communication in future.
